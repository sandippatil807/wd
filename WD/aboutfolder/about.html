			The social and non-government agencies can help the country to fight this situation by spreading awareness among people and guiding them instead of creating panic. Proper and healthy instructions are required to get the country through the fear of Covid-19. Regular scanning should be done at railway stations, bus stands and airports. No foreigner should be allowed to enter the country. People should stay home for as much time as possible. It should be taken care that no fake messages should be forwarded through social media as it will create panic among people. Only government notices and messages should be forwarded. Panic will only create stress and it is the need of the hour to keep calm and be aware.

			Social and non-government organisations can help the government of India by allocating among themselves areas to be supervised by them. They must ensure in their specified localityâ€™s grocery stores that customers are not hoarding essential commodities and should try to prevent panic-buying. They must also check the availability of masks and sanitisers at medical store and that they are not selling the same at exorbitant prices.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this technical and modern world, everything has become advanced. In such times, it becomes our responsibility to deal with such a deadly virus intelligently and sensibly. Social media influencers can aware people to be safe and must maintain cleanliness at homes and around their surroundings. NGOs should provide the knowledge of how to keep themselves safe while sneezing and coughing. The organisations should spread awareness among the illiterate and rural communities on how to be safe at such times.
