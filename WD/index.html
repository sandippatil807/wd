        <h1>Caring</h1>
        <p>
          Witness the growth spurt in non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
          you would be forgiven for thinking the world becomes a more caring
          place every day..Focusing on alleviating poverty and social exclusion.
          We do this through well-planned and comprehensive programmes in
          health, education, livelihoods and disaster preparedness and response.
          We are helping frontline workers stay safe with distributing dry
          rations to feed the needy, raising awareness in our programme
          areas.The common factor uniting this group, apart from the fact that
          they were neither government agencies nor businesses in the
          traditional sense, is that they would have an avowed mission to work
          for a social good – whether it was as torchbearers for human rights,
          the environment or just old-fashioned ‘development’

          Along with governments and corporations, the two torrents of power in
          the global landscape, NGOs are seen as a third force. Indeed, the big
          international ones – the BINGOs – with budgets of hundreds of millions
          of dollars are pretty powerful. But are they a countervailing force,
          striving tirelessly for social justice and the underdog? Poverty
          alleviation may be the rhetoric, critics argue, but in practice little
          that is lasting has been achieved on this front by NGO activism.

        <h2>Spreading Awareness</h2>
        <p>
          The social and non-government agencies can help the country to fight
          this situation by spreading awareness among people and guiding them
          instead of creating panic. Proper and healthy instructions are
          required to get the country through the fear of Covid-19. Regular
          scanning should be done at railway stations, bus stands and airports.
          No foreigner should be allowed to enter the country. People should
          stay home for as much time as possible. It should be taken care that
          no fake messages should be forwarded through social media as it will
          create panic among people. Only government notices and messages should
          be forwarded. Panic will only create stress and it is the need of the
          hour to keep calm and be aware.
        </p>
        <p>
          According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 11,000
          people have died all over the world due to coronavirus and thousands
          have been suspected to succumb to the disease. There is a strong need
          to tackle this crisis. For this, NGOs can help the government by
          providing them financial support. Many social organisations can also
          aware general public about how to prevent themselves from the virus.
          Charitable hospitals should provide the free medical treatment and
          medicine to public and guide them to follow the rules and guidelines
          issued by the government to curb this crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social and non-government organisations can help the government of
          India by allocating among themselves areas to be supervised by them.
          They must ensure in their specified locality’s grocery stores that
          customers are not hoarding essential commodities and should try to
          prevent panic-buying. They must also check the availability of masks
          and sanitisers at medical store and that they are not selling the same
          at exorbitant prices.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is growing anxiety about the potential dire consequences of the
          virus. Government should order to close non-essential business. They
          should work towards helping families that might be affected by closure
          of businesses and possible layoffs. NGOs should offer assistance to
          those in need and open up portals for those who want to help to donate
          masks, hand sanitisers and other essential commodities. Awareness
          videos should be made by NGOs to teach people about the virus, its
          symptoms and precautions. Proper screening of people should be done
          before entering crowded public places such as malls.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this technical and modern world, everything has become advanced. In
          such times, it becomes our responsibility to deal with such a deadly
          virus intelligently and sensibly. Social media influencers can aware
          people to be safe and must maintain cleanliness at homes and around
          their surroundings. NGOs should provide the knowledge of how to keep
          themselves safe while sneezing and coughing. The organisations should
          spread awareness among the illiterate and rural communities on how to
          be safe at such times.
        </p>
        <p>
          Social and non-government organisations could play a positive role to
          aware and protect people. The government is issuing various measures
          and advisories to contain the spread of coronavirus. But to properly
          educate masses at ground level about but to dos and don’ts at work
          place and home or during travelling, no one can do it better than
          these organisations. NGOs may organise small seminars, especially in
          marginalised colonies, where people have limited access to mass media,
          to aware them and conduct health check ups as well. As situation is
          alarming by the day, it is clear that panic among public may surge.
          NGOs can help the government to calm people by using local social
          connections.

          The term ‘non-government organisation’ includes various categories of
          entities that operate not to obtain financial gain, and also do not
          belong to government sector. NGOs are an integral part of a democratic
          society. Sociological sciences lay emphasis on their importance in
          enhancing social integration, implementation of the principle of
          subsidiarity, building civil society, social dialogue and
          participatory democracy. The main tasks of NGOs in the health system
          are providing services and health advocacy. Provision of services
          includes medical, social and psychological services as well as,
          integration activities, care and nursing, material and financial
          support, educational and information services and training. Health
          advocacy is a combination of individual and social actions designed to
          gain political commitment, policy support, social acceptance and
          systems support for a particular health goal or program. An important
          task carried out by NGOs is participation in the formation of health
          policy. The increasing role of NGOs in providing social services and
          the participation in political processes, result in the need to
          confirm the validity and credibility of their operation. One of the
          ways could be to introduce the mechanisms to assess quality and
          efficiency, such as registration as a part of a legal system,
          self-regulatory activities (card rules, codes of ethics),
          certification, participation in networks, monitoring and audit.
